# 3DPortfolio: My Personal 3D Portfolio

**3DPortfolio** is a fully interactive personal website built using **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **GSAP**. Designed to showcase personal content in a unique and engaging way, it places sections like **About Me**, **Contact**, **Music**, **Games**, and **Projects** as animated 3D screens embedded directly within the scene.

Users can explore the 3D space through smooth camera transitions and interact with each section via real HTML content rendered on 3D object surfaces. The experience blends traditional web design with immersive visuals and includes **multilanguage support** and **music controls**.

This project was developed on **August 2025**.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment** – Navigate a virtual space with fully interactive content.
- **GSAP-Powered Camera** – Smooth, animated transitions between points of interest.
- **HTML on 3D Models** – Embed real HTML content on 3D surfaces (e.g., screens).
